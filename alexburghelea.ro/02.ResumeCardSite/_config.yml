    I am a software developer and IT enthusiast based in Bucharest, Romania. I am experienced with a broad range of
    software tools and share my passion for technology in business. Nevertheless, I fool around and I'm a TV Series
    addict. I'm passionate about military airplanes and public speaking.
    <br/>
    Long term objective: continue to work on things that I truly enjoy and maybe help develop the new generation of
    Airplane Autopilot System.
